# Hey, I'm James üëã

Software engineer from the UK passionate about building at the intersection of engineering excellence and emerging tech.

## What I'm About

I've been deep in the AI space since before it was cool following researchers like Demis Hassabis, David Silver, and Geoffrey Hinton when they were still considered niche. Now I work with cutting-edge frontier models, from generative AI to agentic workflows, always exploring what's next.

My journey started with Little Man Computer (LMC) and evolved through the entire stack. These days, I'm particularly obsessed with the TypeScript ecosystem. I've also ventured into Web3, building on Solana with Rust/Anchor. I also love reverse-engineering; especially bot-detection systems which resulted in a great understanding of how bots work and opperate and the fingerprinting methods to detect them.

## Tech I Work With

**Daily drivers:** TypeScript, React/Next.js, Node.js, React Native/Expo  
**Mobile:** Swift/SwiftUI, React Native  
**Languages:** JavaScript, Python, Java, Rust, Go  
**Cloud & Infra:** AWS (Lambda, Step Functions, EKS), Docker, Kubernetes  
**AI/ML:** Working with SOTA models, RAG systems, agent frameworks  
**Web3:** Solana, Anchor framework  

## Current Interests

- **AI Engineering:** Building with frontier models, exploring agentic systems, and following the latest from OpenAI, Anthropic, and the broader AI research community
- **Full-Stack TypeScript:** Pushing the boundaries with Next.js, Three.js for WebGL, and type-safe architectures
- **System Design:** Scaling from zero to millions, distributed systems, and performance optimisation
- **Creative Coding:** Three.js, shaders, generative art, and pushing what's possible in the browser

## What I'm Learning

Always expanding ‚Äî currently diving deeper into:
- Advanced Three.js and GLSL shaders
- Robotics and embodied AI
- Effect-TS for better error handling patterns
- System design at scale

## Featured Projects

| Project | Description | Stack |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Echo** üö® | Disaster communication platform for when infrastructure fails | React Native, Express.js, Offline-first architecture |
| **Domain-Grabber** üõ°Ô∏è | Pentesting tool for subdomain discovery and reconnaissance | Node.js, Automation |
| **Picom** ü§ñ | Smart intercom using audio fingerprinting | Python, Raspberry Pi, Real-time processing |

## Philosophy

I believe in:
- Building software that's not just functional, but delightful
- Staying on the bleeding edge while shipping production-ready code
- Learning in public and sharing knowledge with the community
