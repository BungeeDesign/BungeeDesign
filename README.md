Of course\! That's a fantastic and modern tech stack. Let's overhaul the previous README to showcase your advanced skills, new portfolio link, and impressive educational background.

This revised version is more detailed, better organized, and tailored to reflect a developer with a strong foundation in both formal computer science and a wide array of cutting-edge technologies.

Just copy and paste the Markdown code below into the `README.md` file in your `BungeeDesign` repository.

# Hi there, I'm James! üëã

<a href="https://j3s.me" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Portfolio-j3s.me-blue?style=for-the-badge&logo=icloud" alt="Portfolio"></a>

I'm a software developer based in the UK with a First Class BSc in Computer Science. My journey into tech began with self-taught exploration, which evolved into a deep passion for building robust, scalable, and innovative solutions. I thrive on architecting complex systems and have a strong interest in everything from full-stack web and mobile development to cloud infrastructure and Web3.

I'm always eager to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects.

## üì´ Get In Touch

I'm always open to discussing new projects, creative ideas, or opportunities to be part of an ambitious team.

  * **Portfolio:** [**j3s.me**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://j3s.me)
  * **LinkedIn:** [your-linkedin-profile](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.linkedin.com/in/your-linkedin-profile/)
  * **Email:** your-email@example.com

### How to Customize:

1.  **Update Placeholders:** Make sure to change the LinkedIn URL and email address to your own.
2.  **Refine Project Tech:** I've made some educated guesses on the technologies for your featured projects based on your new list. I highly recommend you review and edit them to be perfectly accurate. For example, did "echo" use `React Native` and `AWS Lambda`? Updating this adds a lot of credibility.
3.  **Commit the changes**, and your new, professional README will be live on your profile\!
