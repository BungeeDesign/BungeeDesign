                    <p>Macwear Clothing came to us wanting an online store for there work-wear and embroidery service. We built them a bespoke Shopify store that allows customers to customise each product via the custom developed Macwear Customiser app.
                       We made sure that the customiser app was easy to use and made it simple for customers to add there logo or text to any product.

                    </div>
                    <p>In order to manage the custom orders from the site a custom order management system had to be built on top of the exsisting Shopify order system.
                       After months of planning and research we built MOS (Macwear Order System) the system is a cloud based application that uses Shopifys order API. We built the app using Node.js (Express) aswell as EJS for
                       the templaiting engine. We also created a custom REST API within the app to handle the acception and rejection system.
